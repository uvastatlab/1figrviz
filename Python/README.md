# 1Science-1Figr-Code-Sharing for Python


GitHub repository for 1Figr data


Most of these files contain functions which only require your institution's original 1Figr dataset in order to run, however, 
some of them require supplemental files which are specific to the University of Virginia. Each figure's corresponding file is noted below along with supplemental requirements needed to re-create each chart.


1. Figure Dependencies on Files. These are the supporting and auxilary files needed in order to run the functions in these 
files.

  1FigrFunctions.py - Original 1Figr Dataset. This file contains extra functions from previous iterations of the project which 
may or may not be of interest
