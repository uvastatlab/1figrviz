# 1Science-1Figr-Code-Sharing for Python


GitHub repository for 1Figr data


Steps to use data...

1. Download the file 'sandbox.py' from this repository

2. Open 'sandbox.py' and at the top of the file, change the 'filename' variable to the path where your 1Figr data is located

3. Change the 'your_institution' variable to the name of your institution

4. Each function is meant to run independently. They should read directly from your 1Figr excel file. Each file crunches the 
data and produces a chart with the outcome. Execute the functions you are interested in.
